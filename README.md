- 👋 Hi, I’m @samuelludwig, and this is not a place of honor.
- 👀 I’m interested in building things; no highly esteemed deed is commemorated here.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning things; nothing valued is here.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on something I'm sure; what is here was dangerous and repulsive to us.
- 📫 How to reach me: most certainly not by phone; this message is a warning about danger.
